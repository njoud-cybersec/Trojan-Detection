# Trojan Detection using Machine Learning

## Description
Machine Learning project to detect Trojan software using SVM and Logistic Regression.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/trojan-detection/data)  
Instructions: Download the CSV file from Kaggle and place it in the project folder before running the code.

## Libraries
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Missing value handling
- Feature selection using SelectKBest
- Model training: SVM (RBF kernel) and Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation with confusion matrix and classification report

## How to run
1. Load dataset CSV
2. Run `main.py` or notebook
3. Check results and confusion matrices
